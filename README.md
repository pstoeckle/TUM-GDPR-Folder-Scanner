# TUM-GDPR-Folder-Scanner

Students at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en/) have the right to request to information on personal data after Art. 17 GDPR.
I wrote this script to check local folders for such information.

## Usage


```shell
$ tum-gdpr-folder-scanner --help
Usage: tum-gdpr-folder-scanner [OPTIONS] [DIRECTORY]

  Scans all relevant files (CSV, PDF, TXT, XLSX, XML) for the given name, TUM
  name, and matriculation number.

Arguments:
  [DIRECTORY]  The directory we want to analyze.  [default: .]

  -n, --name-to-search TEXT       The name we are looking for. Please write
                                  the name in the form `Lastname Firstname` or
                                  `Firstname Lastname`.
